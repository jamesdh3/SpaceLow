# SpaceLow

A work in progress for a Unity 3D low-poly space game.  This project has been in development since late December 2020 between a friend and myself.  We have been using Unity Collab to commit our changes, but I wanted a copy of this backed up in GitHub.

This README will be updated as the game further progresses.  Everything is WIP at the moment (including the name).
